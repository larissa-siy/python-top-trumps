# python-top-trumps
In this project I coded a top trumps game in Python

1. I used import requests to allow the IDE to import http requests
2. I imported random module to allow a random number generation-related function
3. Used a function to get Pokémon stats from the URL.
4. Used a dictionary to list the stats to retrieve from the API
5. Used input to allow the players to input their information into the terminal
6. Used string formatting to show the Pokémon randomly selected from the API
7. Used Elif statements to compare the selected stat and determine who wins the game.
